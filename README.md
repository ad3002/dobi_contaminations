# Datasets

A directory structure with sizes is available here http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/public/. A list of availbale WGS (Whole Genome Shotgun) and TSA (Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly) assemblies are available here http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/.

```
Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) sequencing projects are incomplete genomes or incomplete chromosomes that are being sequenced by a whole genome shotgun strategy. WGS assemblies may be annotated, but annotation is not required. Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (TSA) sequences are computationally assembled sequences from primary data such as ESTs, traces and Next Generation Sequencing Technologies.
